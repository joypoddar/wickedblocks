## WICKEDBLOCKS.
WICKEDBLOCKS is a growing collection of more than 120 layout blocks and components built with Tailwind CSS V2. All are ready to copy paste to your Tailwind project.


## Why WICKEDBLOCKS?
Because we ain't got time for that! Let's be productive and deploy our work even quicker.

## Build status.
Superb, all working.

## Code Style.
I have used Headwind for VS Code "as is", with no configuration, nothing, nada! The way to tidy up the classes is the original Headwing way of doing it, but I have probably messed up somewhere, because Headwind was quicker than me to move the class 1 or 2 spaces to left or right.

For example, this is a paragraph:

```
<p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed text-center text-gray-700 lg:text-left lg:text-1xl">

              <!---- Text goes here ----->    
	      
</p>
```

## Tech stack.
The blocks are only written with  HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS V2 as it says on the site. For navigation, and some other blocks, I used Alpine.js because that's the point of it.


## How to use WickedBlocks.
- Navigato to https://blocks.wickedtemplates.com/
- Choose the block/section that you neadd for your project.
- Visualize the markup, HTML by selecting the tab "code".
- Click on the copy icon.
- Paste into your project.

*Sections have the same padding, you can go ahead to change it to yours. I personally would recommend to use px-5 lg:px-20 or lg:px-24 on all your sections. so you can have a nice white space and consistence.

*Remember that sections contain comments when you copy them, be sure to remove the arrows wrapping the markup.

Example of a website layout using only these blocks can be found on this codepen.
